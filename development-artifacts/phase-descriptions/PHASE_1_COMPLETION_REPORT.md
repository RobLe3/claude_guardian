2. **GraphQL Resolvers** - Implementation of resolver functions needed
3. **ML Models** - Threat detection models need training data
4. **Monitoring** - Prometheus metrics implementation pending

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Performance Testing** - Load testing of all services
2. **Security Penetration Testing** - Third-party security audit
3. **Documentation** - API documentation generation
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated build and deployment
