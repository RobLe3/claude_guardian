# Go Services Architecture Exploration

**Status**: Archived for future reference  
**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Version**: Exploration for potential v2.0.0+ microservices architecture

## Overview

This directory contains a well-structured Go microservices architecture that was explored as part of Claude Guardian's evolution. While professionally designed and following Go best practices, these services are incomplete and were archived to maintain focus on the production-ready FastAPI v2.0.0-alpha implementation.

## Architecture

- **`cmd/`**: 5 main service entry points (auth, config, detection, gateway, monitoring)
- **`internal/`**: Shared internal packages (auth, config, db, gateway, models)
- **`pkg/`**: Reusable components (config, database, health, logger, metrics, redis)  
- **`services/`**: 13 specialized Go services
- **`go.mod`**: Module configuration with comprehensive dependencies

## Status

- ✅ **Structure**: Professional microservices architecture
- ✅ **Dependencies**: Well-configured with Gin, JWT, PostgreSQL, Redis
- ❌ **Implementation**: Core functionality contains placeholder/TODO code
- ❌ **Integration**: Missing internal packages prevent compilation
- ❌ **Current Use**: Not integrated with FastAPI v2.0.0-alpha

## Future Potential

This code provides excellent reference for:
- Go microservices architecture patterns
- Database integration approaches
- Health monitoring and observability
- Configuration management
- Service discovery patterns

## Recommendation

Keep archived for potential future Go migration or as reference for microservices best practices. Current production focus should remain on the proven FastAPI v2.0.0-alpha platform which achieves all performance and functionality targets.
