# Docker Configuration Archive

**Purpose**: Historical Docker configurations for reference  
**Date**: August 26, 2025  

## Archived Configurations

### Production Configurations
- **`docker-compose.production-simple.yml`**: Simplified production stack (archived from deployments/production/docker-compose.yml)
  - Less complex than the main production configuration
  - Good reference for basic production deployment patterns

## Current Active Configurations

**Main Repository** (still active):
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Primary production stack
- **`docker-compose.minimal.yml`**: MCP-only minimal stack  
- **`docker-compose.dev.yaml`**: Development environment
- **`deployments/production/docker-compose.production.yml`**: Advanced production stack

## Usage Notes

These archived configurations are preserved for:
- Historical reference during development
- Alternative deployment pattern examples
- Fallback configurations if needed
- Learning different Docker composition approaches

All archived configurations should be considered non-production and may require updates to work with current codebase.
