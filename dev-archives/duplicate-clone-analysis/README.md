# Duplicate Clone Analysis

**Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Context**: Analysis of content from duplicate Claude Guardian repository clone  
**Location**: `/Users/roble/Documents/Python/claudette/claude_guardian`

## Overview

This directory preserves unique content found in a duplicate repository clone that was discovered during repository cleanup. The duplicate was created in a Claude Code development environment context.

## Preserved Files

### Go Test Files
- **`simple-test.go`**: Proof of concept Go test file - tests Qdrant connection and Go service startup
- **`test-integration.go`**: Integration test file 
- **`docker-compose.production-simple.yml`**: Alternative production Docker configuration

### Key Findings from simple-test.go:
```go
// Simple Go test to verify integration capability with existing services
func main() {
    fmt.Println("üîç Claude Guardian Go Integration Test")
    // Test Qdrant connection (running on port 6333)
    testQdrant()
    // Test if we can start Go service alongside Python MCP (port 8083)  
    startGoService()
}
```

This shows the duplicate was being used for **Go integration testing** with existing Claude Guardian services.

## Clone Characteristics

**Git Configuration**:
- **Remote**: `https://github.com/RobLe3/claude_guardian.git` (HTTPS)
- **Status**: Had staged changes mirroring primary repository cleanup
- **History**: Same commit history as primary repository

**Context**:
- Located in `/Users/roble/Documents/Python/claudette/` 
- Associated with Claude Code development environment (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
- Created during split horizon working directory confusion

## Analysis Notes

The duplicate clone appears to have been created during Claude Code development sessions when working directory context was confused between:
- Primary repository: `/Users/roble/Documents/Python/IFF` (SSH)
- Development environment: `/Users/roble/Documents/Python/claudette/`

This represents a **Claude Code working directory management issue** rather than a Claude Guardian problem.

## Recommendations

1. **Prevention**: Establish clear working directory protocols for Claude Code sessions
2. **Cleanup**: Remove duplicate clones after preserving unique content
3. **Documentation**: Record this as a Claude Code workflow issue for future resolution
