## üìã Remaining TODOs (Pre-Production)

### üî¥ High Priority (Security Critical)
1. **Implement authentication/authorization** for security-sensitive endpoints
   - Current state: All MCP endpoints publicly accessible
   - Risk: Production security vulnerability
   - Timeline: Before production deployment

2. **Secure configuration endpoint** exposure
   - Current state: `/admin/config` exposes database URLs and secrets
   - Risk: Information disclosure vulnerability  
   - Timeline: Before production deployment

3. **Add missing dependency handling** for psutil
   - Current state: Admin endpoints fail with 500 errors
   - Risk: Reduced functionality
   - Timeline: Next sprint

### üü° Medium Priority (Operational)
4. **Implement rate limiting** and request throttling
   - Current state: No rate limiting in place
   - Risk: Potential DoS vulnerability
   - Timeline: Production enhancement

5. **Add real logging and metrics collection**
   - Current state: Placeholder implementations
   - Risk: Limited operational visibility
   - Timeline: Production monitoring setup

6. **Database connection retry logic**
   - Current state: Basic error handling
   - Risk: Reduced resilience during outages
   - Timeline: Operational improvement

### üü¢ Low Priority (Enhancement)
7. **Enhanced security pattern coverage**
   - Current state: 77.8% accuracy, gaps in evasion resistance
   - Target: 90%+ accuracy with advanced pattern detection
   - Timeline: Feature enhancement

8. **Advanced monitoring and alerting**
   - Current state: Basic health checks
   - Target: Comprehensive observability stack
   - Timeline: Future enhancement
